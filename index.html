<p>Google Now Swipe Disabler is free, but if you find it useful and want to support its development, you can make a donation by <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.AdrianCampos.gnsddonate">purchasing the "Donate"</a> version from the Play Store. Since I want to offer the best features for free, you won't be getting any additional useful features.. but you might get some "fun" things to play around with inside the app. (No promises, you're not buying those features, it's a donation. Just thought I'd make that clear.)</p>

<p>To get updates and participate in the beta program join the <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/101796628081413739274">community</a> on Google+.</p>

<ul>
<li>After <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.AdrianCampos.googlenowswipedisabler">downloading</a>, swipe up from the bottom of your screen.</li>
<li>A box asking what to do with the gesture will come up. Choose to always use Google Now Swipe Disabler. You can change this later by tapping the "Clear defaults" button in the app's menu.</li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h3>

<ul>
<li>If you only want the swipe to do nothing, you're done! If not, you can go into Google Now Swipe Disabler and choose an action under the "Choose action" button.</li>

<p>First check <a href="https://github.com/aecl755/GoogleNowSwipeDisabler/issues">issues</a> and see if the bug has already
been reported. If not, create a new issue with:</p>

<ul>
<li>App version</li>
<li>Android Version</li>
<li>Device make/model</li>
<li>And of course, what's going wrong</li>
</ul><p>It's also helpful if you report the crash using android's crash report system. Go ahead and write the issue number in the "User messages" section.</p>

<p>I've gotten plenty of emails asking for this feature, and I'd love to add it, but android won't let me. I'm able to invoke the menu button on myself(the app's self), but that won't do any good. Without root, it is impossible (I think, please please correct me if I'm wrong) to send a menu button press.</p>

<p>Hm, maybe. I may have already thought of it, and found it impractical to add, but feel free to send me an email with your request and I'll try my best to add it. :)</p>

<p>If you'd like to help translate this app to your language, download the and I'll be glad to add the translation to the app.</p>
