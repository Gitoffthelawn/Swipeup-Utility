[![][SmIcon]][PlaystoreLink] Swipup Utility
======================
### Hello,
Swipup Utility is free, but if you find it useful and want to support its development, you can make a donation by [purchasing the "Donate"][DonateLink] version from the Play Store. Since I want to offer the best features for free, you won't be getting any additional *useful* features- those are all in the free versoin. ..but you might get some "fun" things to play around with inside the app. (No promises, you're not buying those features, it's a donation. Just thought I'd make that clear.)

To get updates and participate in the beta program join the [community][G+community] on Google+. Once in the beta, you'll be among the first to recieve bugfixes and new features, but you might experience little quirks or (hopefully not) crashes.

---

# How-to
### First Setup
* After [downloading][PlaystoreLink], swipe up from the bottom of your screen.
* A box asking what to do with the gesture will come up. Choose to always use Swipup Utility. You can change this later by tapping the "Clear defaults" button in the app's menu.

### Usage
* If you only want the swipe to do nothing, you're done! If not, you can go into Swipup Utility and choose an action under the "Choose action" button.


# FAQ




### The app isn't working for me. It's crashing or there's some weird bug.
First check [issues](https://github.com/aecl755/GoogleNowSwipeDisabler/issues) and see if the bug has already
been reported. If not, create a new issue with:

 * App version
 * Android Version
 * Device make/model
 * And of course, what's going wrong

It's also helpful if you report the crash using android's crash report system. Go ahead and write the issue number in the "User messages" section.

### Can you add the menu button as a special action?
I've gotten plenty of emails asking for this feature, and I'd love to add it, but android won't let me. I'm able to invoke the menu button on myself(the app's self), but that won't do any good. Without root, it is impossible (I think, please please correct me if I'm wrong) to send a menu button press.

### Can you add ___ as a special action?
Hm, maybe. I may have already thought of it, and found it impractical to add, but I most likely haven't so create a new [issue](https://github.com/aecl755/GoogleNowSwipeDisabler/issues) with the label "Action request" and I'll try my best to add it. :)


### Can you write the app in my language?
If you'd like to help translate this app to your language, download the and I'll be glad to add the translation to the app.
I'm trying out www.localize.io as a service to help crowd-translate. If you'd like to contribute, go to http://www.localize.io/projects/39 and translate some strings into your language and I'll be sure to include it in the app. Thanks.

### Can I change the icon in the semicircle? Sometimes it's a Google logo, other times it's a magnifying glass, and with the app, it's not there at all.
"You cannot change the manifest or the resource in a signed-and-sealed APK, except through a software upgrade." That pretty much answers it. In order to change the icon, I'd need to release an update with that new icon set as default. So the app itself cannot add a new icon (or take from another app) for its own use. I could include a few set in stone icons to choose from, so if you have any ideas, shoot me an email and I'll consider adding them. :)


### My question isn't listed here :o
Feel free to ask me via email or post an [issue](https://github.com/aecl755/GoogleNowSwipeDisabler/issues) with your question and I'll be happy to help.
